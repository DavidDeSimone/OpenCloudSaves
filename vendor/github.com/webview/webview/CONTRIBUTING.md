### Guidelines for Contributing Examples

All examples will be held to the same standard as the main codebase.

Additionally, examples should...
- Be cross platform except under certain circumstances
- Highlight a subset of the webview library's API
- Be well documented
- Have a simple goal in mind and lack large dependencies
- Link to external libraries instead of copying them to the webview repo
